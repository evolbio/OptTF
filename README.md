Directories output/ and analysis/ with all parameters, output data, and plots for runs used in manuscript plus many other sample runs are only available on Zenodo at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6798421 [link not yet active, will be activated soon], which also includes the GitHub code tagged as version zenodo_1.0. 

[GitHub](https://github.com/evolbio/OptTF) has the source code along with this file but without the output/ and analysis/ directories. Small updates will be posted on GitHub without updating the Zenodo version. In other words, GitHub is the best place for the source code, and Zenodo is the best place for the extra files in the output/ and analysis/ directories.

# Getting started with the code

## Julia setup and installing the code

## Test example

# Sample output and graphics

To start, get the output and analysis directories from Zenodo at the [link above](#OptTF: Overview)

## Loading a prior run for plotting and further analysis

Add note about finding the git version for a prior run, resetting Julia to match
